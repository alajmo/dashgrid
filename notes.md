## ISSUES

2.2[]  Board initialization, doesn't respect numRows / numColumns aka grid display is not updated.
2.3[]  When grid larger than window size, dragging / resizing a box moves it to the initial
       window frame.
        Comment: It probably has to do with diffX / diffY not being correct when scroll is minimizing
